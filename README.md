TravelXOXO - For the world traveller. 

Keep track of the great trips you have taken and the friends you have made.   Although TravelXOXO is not a social networking app, it is easy to email trips and pins with friends and family.  TravelXOXO performs two functions:
- When I was a child, my grandparents had a giant wall map that I loved to look at.  They placed pins on the map and connected them with colored string to show the places they had been and the trips that they had taken.  
- After living abroad, I wanted a way to keep track of where my friends were - a difficult proposition, considering that they moved around just as much as I did.  I didn't want a social networking app to keep tabs on everyone, just a simple map where I could place a pin with a name and photo on it.
I created TravelXOXO because it is the map that I always wanted.

Installation Instructions:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

You are welcome to run TravelXOXO in your xCode simulator.  Alternatively, feel free to request the ipa file, which would allow you to install it on your iPhone or iPad, and to import data to play with.  (There isn't much to look at without any data.)  The disadvantage, of course, is that we would have to deal with provisioning, which isn't much fun.    

  
You will use iTunes, using your Mac, to install the app.
1) connect your iPhone/iPad to your Mac
2) double click on the TravelXOXO.ipa file 
3) open iTunes
4) In iTunes, click the device button in the upper-right corner of the window.
5) Select the Apps button.  The TravelXOXO (a.k.a. CSFriends) appears in the iTunes app list.  Click install.
6) Click Apply (bottom right)

Import Data (it is nice to have a little bit of data to play with)
1) on your iPhone/iPad open your email and find the email with the archive file in it
2) double click on the archive file
3) follow directions
After you finish importing the data, select the tags you wish to view (either instructions, or if you want to just experiment, start with the Europe Trip) and hit the back button to return to the main screen.
